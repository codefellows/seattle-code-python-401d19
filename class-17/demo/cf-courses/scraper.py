Demo of scraping Code Fellows Courses
"""

###############
# step 1
# Let's scrape Code Fellows site to get a quick feel for what's covered in 401 Python Course.
#
# Big Note: I checked with owners of the web site about scraping. That's not legally required (there was even a Supreme Court case about it!) but it's a best practice.
# In this case I was steered toward the staging site vs. live one so our experemints didn't confuse their analytics.
#
# We need an http client to make an http request and get access to web page content.
# In earlier courses you probably used axios or superagent
# In Python the most popular client is called requests
# pip install requests
###############

import requests

URL = "https://testing-www.codefellows.org/courses/code-400/"
page = requests.get(URL)


###############
# step 2
# Once we have the content it will be in raw html form, which is great for a browser, but not as easy for a human being to read.
# So let's see if we can make sense of the raw html by parsing it
###############

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# BeautifulSoup can parse many types of content.
# We're parsing html so let BeautifulSoup know
# conventionally you store the BeatifulSoup instance in a variable named soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")

###############
# step 3
# The soup instance has powerful capabilities for finding one or many elements based on different criteria
###############

# here we're finding the first element with the given class
# NOTE: use class_ since class by itself is a Python keyword
results = soup.find(class_="course-details")

# calling prettify method makes output a lot easier to read
# print(results.prettify())

###############
# step 4
# We can then perform finds on previously found items
# In this case we want to find all instead of just one
###############

titles = results.find_all("h3")

###############
# step 5
# result of find_all is iterable and can be used in for loops
###############
# for title in titles:
#     print(title.text)

###############
# step 6
###############

# find_all is so common there's a shortcut
anchors = results("a")

# for anchor in anchors:
#     print(anchor)

###############
# step 7
###############

# ResultSets are iterable and can be used in comprehensions
links = [anchor["href"] for anchor in anchors]

# print(links)

###############
# step 8
###############
python_link = links[1]
python_url = "https://testing-www.codefellows.org" + python_link
python_response = requests.get(python_url)
python_soup = BeautifulSoup(python_response.content, "html.parser")
article = python_soup("article")[1]
list_items = article.select("ul li ul li")

# get details about the object you're working with
# print(dir(titles[1]))

print(titles[1].text)
for li in list_items:
    print(li.text)
