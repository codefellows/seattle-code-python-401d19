# Data Structures and Algorithms Review

## Overview

Today is our chance to look back over all the Data Structures and Algorithms we've learned.

We'll go over whiteboarding strategies and computational thinking tips.

We'll look at how to tease out when a particular Data Structure or Algorithm is the best fit.

We'll review Big O and consider what to do when we're using a core language feature with unknown space/time complexity.
