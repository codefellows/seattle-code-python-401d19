# Lab: Scanning the Horizon

## Overview

As you advance in your career as a dev you will need to be constantly on the look out for the latest tools. You will have to strike a balance between chasing after every exciting new tech and being stuck in your ways.

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

You may be tasked with researching a new tool and making a recommendation to your team suggesting that you adopt it or skip it.

Three newer technologies that are getting a lot of buzz are [Python Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html){:target="_blank"}, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/){:target="_blank"}.

Your job is to research one (or more) of the technologies and write up your impression of it, as well as a list of pros and cons.

## Implementation Notes

Do your own research as well, but here are a few links to get you started:
