# Lab: Django with Style

## Overview

Our Snacks projects aren't looking very stylish.

Let's change that by checking out a new kind of "utility first" CSS toolkit named [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Building upon previous lab, your job is to give it some style.

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the [Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn){:target="_blank"} instructions to add Tailwind to head of your html templates.
  - That will probably be "base.html"

### User Acceptance Tests

- No additional acceptance tests required.

## Configuration

- Create new branch on previous lab's repo named `django-with-style`.

Refer to [Lab Submission Instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/){:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.

## Stretch

- Use a 3rd party Tailwind component.
- Customize your user model.
